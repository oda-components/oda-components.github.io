              Rust is a systems programming language designed for safety, performance, and concurrency. It was initially developed by Mozilla and released in 2010. Rust is known for its focus on memory safety without sacrificing low-level control over system resources. Here are some key features and characteristics of the Rust programming language:
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Memory Safety: Rust provides memory safety without relying on garbage collection. It achieves this through a combination of ownership, borrowing, and a strict borrowing checker, ensuring that memory-related bugs like null pointer dereferences or data races are caught at compile time.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Ownership and Borrowing: Rust introduces the concept of ownership, which ensures that each piece of memory has a single owner. Ownership, combined with borrowing and lifetimes, allows for fine-grained control over memory, preventing data races and memory leaks.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Concurrency: Rust is designed to support concurrent programming. Its ownership model and borrowing system make it easy to write concurrent code without introducing data races. The language includes lightweight threads called "tasks" and provides tools for building concurrent and parallel programs.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Zero-Cost Abstractions: Rust aims to provide high-level abstractions without incurring a runtime overhead. This is achieved through a "zero-cost abstraction" principle, where high-level constructs in the language map efficiently to low-level machine code.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Static Typing: Rust is statically typed, and the type system is expressive, allowing for strong type checking. However, it also incorporates type inference, reducing the need for explicit type annotations in many cases.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Pattern Matching: Rust includes a powerful pattern matching syntax, known as "match," which simplifies code for handling different cases and enhances readability.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Functional Programming Features: Rust incorporates functional programming features, such as immutability by default for variables, first-class functions, and closures.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Community and Ecosystem: Rust has a growing and active community. It is supported by a package manager called Cargo, which simplifies dependency management and project building. The Rust ecosystem includes a variety of libraries and frameworks for different domains.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Cross-Platform Support: Rust is designed to be cross-platform and can be used to develop software for a wide range of operating systems.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              No Runtime or Garbage Collector: Rust does not have a runtime or garbage collector, making it suitable for systems programming where low-level control over resources is essential.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Rust is often used for systems-level programming, where performance, control over resources, and memory safety are critical concerns. It has gained popularity in areas such as operating systems, game development, and networking software.
